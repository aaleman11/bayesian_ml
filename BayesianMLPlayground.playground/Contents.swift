/*
 Conditional Probability:
 P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B)
 Read as: The probability of A given B = Probability of A and B divided by the Probability of B
 
 Bayes Rule:
 P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
 
 P(theta|D) = P(D|theta) * P(theta) / P(data)
 
 If events A and B are not independent, then the probability of the intersection of A and B (the probability that both events occur) is defined by
 
 P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B|A)
 P(B|A) = P(A and B)/P(A)
 
 1 pounds = 0.453592 kilograms
 
 P(New Max|Old Max) = P(New Max and Old Max)/P(Old Max)
 
 
 3 x 10 @ 75% - Three sets of 10 reps at 75% of the 1RM
